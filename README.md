# Quantified Self 
This project looks at both of our Spotify listening data (included in the repo) and goes through data cleaning, EDA, and hypothesis testing. It also has
a classification section where we use a kNN classifier to predict which set of data an unseen instance is from. There is also some NLP at the end as well.

This is a Jupyter Notebook, and so it should be run from the top cell down or else the individual cells will not work. It also is using anaconda, so make sure that that is the interpreter being used or else some of the includes will not work. There also is a WordCloud at the end, which needs to be installed seperately from anaconda as well

The code that we use multiple times or takes up a lot of space is in the `utils.py` file, and the more specific code is in code cells in the Notebook
